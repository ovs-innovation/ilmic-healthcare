  {
    question: "How long does the test and tag process go for?",
    answer:
      "The duration of testing and tagging depends on the appliance tested however it should only really take a few minutes at a time. A visual inspection of the appliance takes place prior which in turn aids the technician to judge what electrical test needs to be performed. Some appliances have to go through several tests prior to being labelled as safe and acceptable.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should my test and tag records include?",
    answer:
      "Test and tag records are compliant with the standards in AS/NZS 3760:2010. This involves a succinct history of all the tests along with adequate tagging that displays the date and assessment details of the item. Records of inspection and testing of electrical equipment, including: 1. Register of all electrical equipment 2. Record of formal inspection and tests 3. Record of all faulty equipment showing details of services or corrective actions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a Test and Tag procedure cost?",
    answer:
      "Kure Pharma Test & Tag Melbourne Service fees are based on the number of tests we complete for you. This test rate includes all labour, test equipment, test tags, and reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does my equipment need to be switched off during inspection?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all equipment needs to be turned off before testing can commence. This is to ensure the safety of our technicians and customers. Once an electrical risk assessment has been completed then equipment can be turned back on.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do new items need to be tested?",
    answer:
      "While new items don't require testing, they must still be tagged 'once in service' following the requirements of AS/NZS 3760. New electrical equipment that has never been put into use does not have to be tested before first use, as the supplier is deemed responsible for the initial electrical safety of the new item. However the Manager/Supervisor must ensure that new equipment is inspected for obvious damage before being used and that it is added to a Register upon entering service and is tested during the next scheduled test for their work area. Secondhand equipment must be tested.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my workplace is compliant with safety standards?",
    answer:
      "Regular inspections by certified safety professionals ensure your workplace complies with local safety regulations. Maintaining proper records of testing, repairs, and inspections will also help demonstrate compliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas of my workplace do I need to test and tag to remain, OHS/WHS compliant?",
    answer:
      "It is essential to test and tag all portable and non-portable electrical appliances with a flexible and detachable supply lead in your workplace. Portable appliances are located in more areas than you may realise; like the office kitchen or construction areas.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a Multimeter a sufficient equipment to test portable appliances?",
    answer:
      "A multimeter is not a satisfactory tool as it isn't compliant with AS/NZS3760. Equipment that has an electronic, magnetic or membrane type on/off switch requires mandatory leakage current tests. Some of this equipment can be located in offices, kitchens and construction sites. You must ensure that your service provider does not only rely on a multimeter as it does not meet the testing requirements as outlined in AS/NZS3760.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can test and tag?",
    answer:
      "According to Australian standards, a competent person can test and tag. A suitable person who can perform regulated test and tag services must possess qualifications and/or sufficient knowledge in electrical testing and tagging.",

                The Occupational Health and Safety Act (rev. 2004) requires employers to provide and
                maintain, so far as is reasonably practicable, a working environment for workers and
                independent contractors that is safe and without risks to health. This includes a duty to
                provide or maintain, so far as reasonably practicable, plant or systems of work that are safe
                and without risks to health.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are an employer, self-employed person, an employee, or any person lending a portable
                appliance to another person, you have a duty of care to ensure that the equipment/appliance is
                safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Australian Standard AS/NZS3760 is used by Worksafe Victoria as a minimum safety obligation
                for workplaces to adhere to. Your current insurance policy (including your Public Liability
                cover) may not cover accidents on site caused by equipment that does not comply with the
                relevant laws and safety regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspection and testing must be carried out by a competent person—someone with training,
                qualification and/or experience with the knowledge and skill to complete the task correctly.

              What Item Needs To Be Tested In My Workplace?

            <div className="space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-800">
              <p>Typically, any electrical item with a power lead that is plugged into a power point.</p>

              </ol>
              <p>
              For some types of equipment or electrical items, the frequency of testing is more often where there is a higher safety risk or where it is likely to be greater use and wear. For example, a tradesman or a carpenter has a higher risk factor and needs to have their electrical equipment tested more often than a computer in a standard office. All portable equipment and appliances, electric hand tools, extension leads, power boards and portable residual current devices must be regularly tested for electrical safety. This includes, but is not limited to, equipment such as……… • Computers and laptop chargers • Portable printers & scanners • Portable lighting • Portable heater/cooler • Portable radios/stereos • Portable phone chargers (including mobile phone chargers) • Overhead projector, data projectors and electric whiteboards • Any power boards and extension cords • Vacuum or Steam Cleaner. • Vacuum or Steam Cleaner • Electric fry pans, toaster ovens, sandwich presses etc • Un-mounted microwaves • Portable electric mixers, food processors • Portable electric coffee machine and grinder • Any power boards and extension cords. • Entertainment equipment such as Stereos, Radios, DVD players, TVs etc • Portable lamps and heaters •Toasters, kettles and other portable cooking equipment • Hairdryers, bedside clocks, electric blankets, Iron • All extension leads and power boards • Portable phone chargers. • Toasters, kettles and other portable cooking equipment • Entertainment equipment such as Stereos, Radios, DVD players, TVs etc • Computers and laptop chargers • Portable printers, laminators & scanners • Overhead projector, data projectors and electric whiteboards • Portable lamps and heaters • Portable phone chargers • All extension leads and power boards.
